# Hand-Gesture-Recognition-with-Glove-Functionality-Project
There are times when we cannot physically interact with objects or systems conveniently with the use of our hands. This may be due to the nature of a task with it being deemed as being too high risk in areas such as surgery or hospitality due to contamination (Lai, Ke and Hsu, 2018). This makes it difficult to comfortably train people in these professions without eliminating this element of risk. Other high risk areas where human-interaction recognition is implemented is Bomb disposal, where a robot performs a task based on hand movements made by the human (K. Ray et al., 2018). Many systems in the area of Virtual reality require the user to wear ‘data gloves’ equipped with specialist sensors which can prove costly and inconvenient.
